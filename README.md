## Description
This app makes it easier than ever before to find new candidates to fill openings at ones company. It also makes it easer for job seekers to find employment. With this application companies have the ability to create job post, then they will be automatically generated a list of qualified candidates which meet the requirements of the job post. Companies will then be able to like or dislike the candidates by swiping through them and viewing their bio about themselves, resume, experience, education, projects, and skills. On the other hand, candidates looking for jobs will be automatically generated a list of job posts that meet their qualifications. Candidates have the ability to like or dislike job post, just how companies can like or dislike candidates. If a company likes a candidate for a job post, and a candidate likes the same job post, they are then matched up. The companies will be provided with the candidates contact information to continue to the next steps.
